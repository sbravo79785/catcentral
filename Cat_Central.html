cat kingdom. They're widely known as the cat of "bad luck", which many believers of
superstition actually believe in. </div>

also don't shed much as other cats and have a great health history. Thier
intelligence is very high and can learn very quickly. These cat's require a lot of
attention and cuddle alot to thier owners. If they are left alone they might get
depressed and sick so it's important to keep them in mind alot. </div>
